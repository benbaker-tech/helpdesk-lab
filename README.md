# helpdesk-lab
Self-directed Tier 1–2 help desk lab with Windows Server, Active Directory, and Microsoft 365.



# Help Desk Lab – Benjamin Baker

This is my self-directed lab environment built to simulate real-world Tier 1–2 help desk responsibilities. The goal is to develop job-ready skills with Microsoft 365, Active Directory, endpoint administration, and IT troubleshooting — then document them like I would in a real support role.

## Tools & Technologies

- Windows Server 2019 (Active Directory, DNS, DHCP)
- Windows 10 (domain-joined endpoint)
- Microsoft 365 Developer Tenant
- Group Policy Management Console (GPMC)
- Microsoft Intune / Endpoint Manager
- PowerShell
- VirtualBox / Hyper-V

## Objectives

- Simulate real support tickets and resolve them like Tier 1/2 techs
- Automate user and software management with PowerShell
- Troubleshoot endpoint and network issues
- Document all fixes in KB-style markdown files
- Build job-ready confidence and public proof of skills
